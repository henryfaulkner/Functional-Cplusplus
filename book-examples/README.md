## What is the C++ STL (Standard Template Library)?

- Contains four parts: algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.), container (data structures), functions (), and iterators (forward, bidirectional, random-access, input/output)
- STL and C++ Standard Library are 2 distinct entities
  - Iteractors:
    - range: a pair of iterators that designate the beginning and end of computation
  - Functions: classes that overload the function call operation (operator()). Instances are call functors or function objects.
